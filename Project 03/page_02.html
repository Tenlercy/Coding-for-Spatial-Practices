                <p>I think the best friend is Kuina. But then sentence had to have been '... promise to keep to my captain and *to* my best friend!!' so i understand the confusion. maybe japanese readers can clear the doubts.</p>

                <p>I read a Spanish translation where zoro refers to the last part about best friend as amiga. Meaning female friend. I believe he didnâ€™t call Luffy his best friend but it was meant for Kuina instead.</p>

                <p>Seconded, the Lunarians are definitely tied to the Void Century. No one seems to know anything about them except for extremely high-level pirates (and Marines, I'd guess).</p>

                <p>Kuina was literally mentioned earlier in the chapter, specifically noting how her connection resonated with him keeping her sword, so yes... she would be the best friend he is talking about. Luffy is his captain.</p>
